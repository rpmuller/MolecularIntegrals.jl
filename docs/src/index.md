# MolecularIntegrals.jl

The goal of MolecularIntegrals.jl is to supply **fast** and
**hackable** one- and two-electron integrals for computational
chemistry calculations.  There are many excellent molecular integral
packages available to Julia programmers, but few are written *in*
Julia. This project will explore how fast we can make these integrals
while maintaining a readable and hackable code base.
