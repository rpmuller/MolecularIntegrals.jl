# TODO and notes

## Create basis set made up of shells, rather than cgbfs
- Test build_shells function
- Build cgbfs from shells list

## Reconcile coulomb(px,s,s,s) with hrr2 calls: 
While working on the new vrr code psss(), I found a discrepancy comparing to coulomb 
that I originally assumed was a mistake in psss(), but which I later found matched
vrr for this code. Which means that it is likely that the following test fails:
@test MolecularIntegrals.vrr(1.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1.0,0,0,0,1.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0,0,0,0) â‰ˆ coulomb(px,s,s,s)
I'm going to move forward with coding the vrr routines, but I'm flagging this as
something to investigate and fix later.

## Improve data structures used for ints in vrr2 and hrr2:
Note on the interface: currently the new vrr routines are returning multidimensional dictionary
arrays over angular momentum states and m. If mmax=0 is submitted, this will reduce the indices in return by 1,
allowing, for example, a 3x1 maxtrix to be accessed as a 3 vector. Could cause problems with higher dimension
returns (3x3x1, e.g.)
- Such a data structure could be using the ao l,m indices to map the I,J,K. There's preliminary code in Basis.jl
- Could also use a SparseArray

## Include lists of primitive exponents to contract vrr2 results
The ultimate new vrr code will return a [ix,iy,iz,jx,jy,jz] matrix. Each term of this will be a primitive 
integral. We will need to find a way to do the contraction over multiple primitives, potentially introducing another index that we'll contract over: [k,ix,iy,iz,jx,jy,jz]. Although an 8-dimensional array is large, none of the dimensions will have very many terms. Still 4^8 is a lot of terms. I wonder whether this will require a more intelligent data structure.

## Only computing, returning symmetric ERI pairs (i>j,k>l) ij>kl
Think about ordering an integral call (ij,kl) such that i>j, k>l, and ij>kl.
Also, put in warning when bsh>ash or dsh>csh in hrr2?

## Move basis functions from bf.x,bf.y,bf.z to bf.xyz
- Also consider a similar move for bf.I, bf.J, bf.K.
- Also make bf(xyz) (amplitude) call vector


## Do a scan and remove all .y, .z
- Use vectors instead
